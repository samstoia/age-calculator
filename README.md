# The Super Galactic Age Calculator

This is an application that will allow people to calculate their age on earth and some other planets in our solar system.  Users will also be able to see how many years they would be expected to live on those planets.

## Specifications

* Based on user input, will calculate their earth age based on birthdate.

* Based on earth birthdate, will calculate user's age in Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter years.

* Based on earth birthdate, will calculate user's life expectancy and determine how many years the user is likely to live on each planet.

* If the user has already surpassed the life expectancy, will tell user how many years they have outlived the average life expectancy.
